## Preface

This matter has been delayed for a long time.

I've always wanted a place to record my thoughts and feelings, not as public as WeChat Moments, nor as private as a diary. I once had a friend who used NetEase Cloud Music to **document (v.记录，记载)** his life, saying, "There are many strangers on WeChat, but only acquaintances can find me on NetEase Cloud Music." At that time, I didn't feel it strongly, but as I grew older and gained more experiences, I gradually realized the importance of recording and understood his wisdom.

Recording is very important. In the past, I thought that living in the moment was the most crucial, that experiencing was more important than recording. This statement isn't wrong, but it was just an excuse for my laziness back then, not understanding its true meaning. The conclusion that "experiencing is more important" only applies when the two **interfere (/ˌɪntəˈfɪə(r)/, v.干涉，干扰)** with each other. Most of the time, <u>**experiencing and recording don't conflict; they can even complement each other**</u>. I can **immerse (/ɪˈmɜːs/, v.使沉浸（于）)** myself in life experiences and record them **simultaneously (/ˌsɪm(ə)lˈteɪniəsli/, adv.同时地)** for future **reminiscence (/ˌremɪˈnɪsns/, n.追忆，怀旧)** .

## Living in Moments

Looking back on over two decades of experiences, only a few moments stand out in my mind. The **mundane (/mʌnˈdeɪn/, n.平凡的事物)** is easily forgotten, and in summarizing one's life, these few moments are given a disproportionately large weight, similar to the **Matthew effect (马太效应)** . Life experiences seem to be "represented" by these moments, so statistically speaking, **<u>the moments you remember are your life</u>**. If you happen to have a poor memory, the importance of recording becomes evident. By documenting your experiences, these memories become easier to recall. When you revisit these records after a long time, you'll **relive (v.重温)** the joy and "experience" it all over again. <u>**Recording is also a form of experiencing**;</u> memories become richer with each revisit. Of course, remembering isn't just mental; it's also physical. The exercises you've done, the runs you've gone on, the weights you've lifted—all leave their marks on your body.

## Recording the Present

Every time I want to write something, I feel I've read too few books, my expression is too weak, and my accumulation is insufficient, making language organization feel "hesitant." A significant reason is to record my current shortcomings, and working on a **bilingual (/ˌbaɪˈlɪŋɡwəl/, adj.双语的)** website can also improve my English level (though I've been busy recently, and it's probably machine-translated 罒ω罒). After translation, reading and polishing it can help me learn something. **<u>I look forward to a better version of myself in the future.</u>**

## Conclusion

Since it's come to this, let's just go to sleep. **<u>Cheer up, i can do it ヾ(◍°∇°◍)ﾉﾞ！</u>**
